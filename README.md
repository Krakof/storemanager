Bonus tasks

1)I've made a schematic markup and editing in a modal window in order to show minimal functionality in a short time (ideally, routing and redux, which simplifies the moments with the workload of the components and the connections between them, should be added).
It also assumes the possibility to set the same intervals for all days and validating fields before saving.

2) The only thing I can say for now - storing time as "string". In my opinion, it may be better change to Date object or an integer. I suppose there are other cons that depend on the type of database used, the operations that are supposed to be applied to the data (filtering, comparison, etc.) and other points not mentioned in the question
